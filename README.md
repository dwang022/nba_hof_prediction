## Project Overview
The question of who should make the Basketball Hall of Fame has inspired countless debates throughout basketball’s many eras. From legends like Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain to Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, only the game’s greatest and most influential players have been immortalized in the Hall of Fame. Even though players need to be retired for three full seasons before they can be considered for induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame, we can use machine learning to predict who will get enshrined. In this article, I will build a logistic regression model to evaluate the chances for current and recently retired NBA stars and explore the career accolades and performance statistics that contribute most to making the Hall of Fame.

If you are only interested in the results, I developed a Python web app that allows you to view the career statistics, accolades, and Hall of Fame probability for any NBA player (past or present): [NBA HOF Prediction App](https://nba-hof-prediction.streamlit.app/)
